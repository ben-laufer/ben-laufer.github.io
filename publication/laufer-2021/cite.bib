 abstract = {Background Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are developmental neurotoxicants implicated as environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum disorders (ASD).Objective We examined the effects of prenatal exposure to a human-relevant mixture of PCBs on the DNA methylome of fetal mouse brain and placenta to determine if there was a shared subset of differentially methylated regions (DMRs).Methods A PCB mixture formulated to model the 12 most abundant congeners detected in the serum of pregnant women from a prospective high-risk ASD cohort was administered to female mice prior to and during pregnancy. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed to assess genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of placenta and brain on gestational day 18.Results We found thousands of significant (empirical p &lt; 0.05) DMRs distinguishing placentas and brains from PCB-exposed embryos from sex-matched vehicle controls. In both placenta and brain, PCB-associated DMRs were significantly (p &lt; 0.005) enriched for functions related to neurodevelopment, cellular adhesion, and cellular signaling, and significantly (Odds Ratio &gt; 2.4, q &lt; 0.003) enriched for bivalent chromatin marks. The placenta and brain PCB DMRs overlapped significantly (Z-score = 4.5, p = 0.0001) by genomic coordinate and mapped to a shared subset of genes significantly (q &lt; 0.05) enriched for Wnt signaling, Slit/Robo signaling, and genes differentially expressed in multiple NDD/ASD models. The placenta and brain DMRs also significantly (q &lt; 0.05) overlapped by genomic coordinate with brain samples from humans with Rett syndrome and Dup15q syndrome.Discussion These results demonstrate that placenta can be used as a surrogate for embryonic brain DNA methylation changes over genes relevant to NDD/ASD in a mouse model of prenatal PCB exposure.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
