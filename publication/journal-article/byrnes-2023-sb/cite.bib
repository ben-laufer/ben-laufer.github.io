 abstract = {Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics are being
investigated for a broad range of neurological diseases. While
ASOs have been effective in the clinic, improving productive ASO
internalization into target cells remains a key area of focus in
the field. Here, we investigated how the delivery of ASO-loaded
lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) affects ASO activity, subcellular
trafficking, and distribution in the brain. We show that
ASO-LNPs increase ASO activity up to 100-fold in cultured
primary brain cells as compared to non-encapsulated ASO.
However, in contrast to the widespread ASO uptake and activity
observed following free ASO delivery in vivo, LNP-delivered ASOs
did not downregulate mRNA levels throughout the brain after
intracerebroventricular injection. This lack of activity was
likely due to ASO accumulation in cells lining the ventricles
and blood vessels. Furthermore, we reveal a
formulation-dependent activation of the immune system post
dosing, suggesting that LNP encapsulation cannot mask cellular
ASO backbone-mediated toxicities. Together, these data provide
insights into how LNP encapsulation affects ASO distribution as
well as activity in the brain, and a foundation that enables
future optimization of brain-targeting ASO-LNPs.},
