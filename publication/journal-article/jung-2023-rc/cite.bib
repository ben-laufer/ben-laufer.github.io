 abstract = {Sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are critical
for maintaining tissue homeostasis by sensing and initiating
responses to stimuli. While most preclinical studies of DRGs are
conducted in rodents, much less is known about the mechanisms of
sensory perception in primates. We generated a transcriptome
atlas of mouse, guinea pig, cynomolgus monkey, and human DRGs by
implementing a common laboratory workflow and multiple
data-integration approaches to generate high-resolution
cross-species mappings of sensory neuron subtypes. Using our
atlas, we identified conserved core modules highlighting
subtype-specific biological processes related to inflammatory
response. We also identified divergent expression of key genes
involved in DRG function, suggesting species-specific
adaptations specifically in nociceptors that likely point to
divergent function of nociceptors. Among these, we validated
that TAFA4, a member of the druggable genome, was expressed in
distinct populations of DRG neurons across species, highlighting
species-specific programs that are critical for therapeutic
development.},
