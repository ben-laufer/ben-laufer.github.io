 abstract = {Oligodendrocyte dysfunction has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, so understanding
oligodendrocyte activation states would shed light on disease
processes. We identify three distinct activation states of
oligodendrocytes from single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of
mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis
(MS): DA1 (disease-associated1, associated with immunogenic
genes), DA2 (disease-associated2, associated with genes
influencing survival), and IFN (associated with interferon
response genes). Spatial analysis of disease-associated
oligodendrocytes (DAOs) in the cuprizone model reveals that DA1
and DA2 are established outside of the lesion area during
demyelination and that DA1 repopulates the lesion during
remyelination. Independent meta-analysis of human single-nucleus
RNA-seq datasets reveals that the transcriptional responses of
MS oligodendrocytes share features with mouse models. In
contrast, the oligodendrocyte activation signature observed in
human AD is largely distinct from those observed in mice. This
catalog of oligodendrocyte activation states
(http://research-pub.gene.com/OligoLandscape/) will be important
to understand disease progression and develop therapeutic
interventions.},
