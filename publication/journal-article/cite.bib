abstract = {{Many women continue to consume low to moderate quantities of alcohol during pregnancy, which can result in the variable neurobehavioural effects in the absence of physiological abnormalities that characterize fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Previously, we reported that a mouse model for FASD based on voluntary maternal ethanol consumption throughout gestation resulted in offspring that showed mild developmental delay, anxiety-related traits, and deficits in spatial learning. Here, we extend this model by evaluating the gene expression changes that occur in the adult brain of C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to ethanol via maternal preference drinking. The results of two independent expression array experiments indicate that ethanol induces subtle but consistent changes to global gene expression. Gene enrichment analysis showed over-represented gene ontology classifications of cellular, embryonic, and nervous system development. Molecular network analysis supported these classifications, with significant networks related to cellular and tissue development, free radical scavenging, and small molecule metabolism. Further, a number of genes identified have previously been implicated in FASD-relevant neurobehavioural phenotypes such as cognitive function (Ache, Bcl2, Cul4b, Dkc1, Ebp, Lcat, Nsdh1, Sstr3), anxiety (Bcl2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Nsdh1), and mood disorders (Bcl2, Otx2, Sstr3). The results suggest a complex residual “footprint” of neurodevelopmental ethanol exposure that may provide a new perspective for identifying mechanisms that underlie the life-long persistence of FASD-related cognitive and behavioural alterations, including potential targets for treatment.}},

Approximately 30\% of parentally imprinted transcripts are ncRNAs that are found abundantly--and in some cases specifically--in the brain; however, the role ncRNA plays during development and day-to-day life is not apparent. Interestingly, \textbackslashtextasciitilde1,300 transcripts show a consistent parental expression bias in the brain. This is in contrast to most tissues that show only rare imprinted transcripts. Furthermore, there are only two clusters of imprinted small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) encoding genes in mammals, which are also expressed in the brain. These clusters, Snrpn-Ube3a (Human 15q11-q13/Murine 7qC) and Dlk1-Dio3 (Human 14q32.2/Murine 12qF1) and rodent specific Sfmbt2 (Murine 2qA1), form the focus of this review. These imprinted clusters are localized to imprinted regions that are associated with processes involved in neuronal plasticity and several neurodevelopmental disorders. Several miRNAs from the Dlk1-Dio3 region are also involved in chromatin methylation and remodelling. The final loci of interest is the proximal region of murine chromosome 2 that contains Sfmbt2 and an overlapping antisense transcript that is unique within mice and rats. This suggests that Sfmbt2 may be in the process of becoming imprinted that is being driven by a cluster of intergenic miRNAs. Ultimately, imprinted clusters of ncRNA have the potential to offer novel insight into the understanding of the complex processes of cognition given their role in brain function.}},

abstract = {{The dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia proposes the mental illness is caused by excessive transmission of dopamine in selected brain regions. Multiple lines of evidence, including blockage of dopamine receptors by antipsychotic drugs that are used to treat schizophrenia, support the hypothesis. However, the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) blockade cannot explain some important aspects of the therapeutic effect of antipsychotic drugs. In this study, we hypothesized that antipsychotic drugs could affect the transcription of genes in the DA pathway by altering their epigenetic profile. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of olanzapine, a commonly used atypical antipsychotic drug, on the DNA methylation status of genes from DA neurotransmission in the brain and liver of rats. Genomic DNA isolated from hippocampus, cerebellum, and liver of olanzapine treated (n = 2) and control (n = 2) rats were analyzed using rat specific methylation arrays. Our results show that olanzapine causes methylation changes in genes encoding for DA receptors (dopamine D1 receptor, dopamine D2 receptor and dopamine D5 receptor), a DA transporter (solute carrier family 18 member 2), a DA synthesis (differential display clone 8), and a DA metabolism (catechol-O-methyltransferase). We assessed a total of 40 genes in the DA pathway and found 19 to be differentially methylated between olanzapine treated and control rats. Most (17/19) genes showed an increase in methylation, in their promoter regions with in silico analysis strongly indicating a functional potential to suppress transcription in the brain. Our results suggest that chronic olanzapine may reduce DA activity by altering gene methylation. It may also explain the delayed therapeutic effect of antipsychotics, which occurs despite rapid dopamine blockade. Furthermore, given the common nature of epigenetic variation, this lends insight into the differential therapeutic response of psychotic patients who display adequate blockage of dopamine receptors.}},

In this study we assessed alterations to adult mouse brain tissue by assaying DNA cytosine methylation and small noncoding RNA (ncRNA) expression, specifically the microRNA (miRNA) and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) subtypes. We found long-lasting alterations in DNA methylation as a result of fetal alcohol exposure, specifically in the imprinted regions of the genome harboring ncRNAs and sequences interacting with regulatory proteins. A large number of major nodes from the identified networks, such as Pten signaling, contained transcriptional repressor CTCF-binding sites in their promoters, illustrating the functional consequences of alcohol-induced changes to DNA methylation. Next, we assessed ncRNA expression using two independent array platforms and quantitative PCR. The results identified 34 genes that are targeted by the deregulated miRNAs. Of these, four (Pten, Nmnat1, Slitrk2 and Otx2) were viewed as being crucial in the context of FASDs given their roles in the brain. Furthermore, ∼20\% of the altered ncRNAs mapped to three imprinted regions (Snrpn-Ube3a, Dlk1-Dio3 and Sfmbt2) that showed differential methylation and have been previously implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The findings of this study help to expand on the mechanisms behind the long-lasting changes in the brain transcriptome of FASD individuals.

The brain is particularly susceptible to alcohol during synaptogenesis, a process that occurs heavily during the third trimester and is characterized by the establishment and pruning of neural circuitry; however, the molecular response of the brain to ethanol during synaptogenesis has not been documented. To model a binge-like exposure during the third-trimester neurodevelopmental equivalent, neonate mice were given a high (5 g/kg over 2 h) dose of ethanol at postnatal day 7. Acute transcript changes within the brain were assessed using expression arrays and analyzed for associations with gene ontology functional categories, canonical pathways, and gene network interactions. The short-term effect of ethanol was characterized by an acute stress response and a downregulation of energetically costly cellular processes. Further, alterations to a number of genes with roles in synaptic transmission and hormonal signaling, particularly those associated with the neuroendocrine development and function, were evident. Ethanol exposure during synaptogenesis was also associated with altered histone deacetylase and microRNA transcript levels, suggesting that abnormal epigenetic patterning may maintain some of the persistent molecular consequences of developmental ethanol exposure. The results shed insight into the sensitivity of the brain to ethanol during the third-trimester equivalent and outline how ethanol-induced alterations to genes associated with neural connectivity may contribute to FASD phenotypes.}},

It involves changes in brain gene expression that underlie lifelong FASD symptoms. How these changes are achieved from immediate to long-term effects, and how they are maintained, is unknown. We have used the C57BL/6J mouse to assess the dynamics of genomic alterations following binge alcohol exposure. Ethanol-exposed fetal (short-term effect) and adult (long-term effect) brains were assessed for gene expression and microRNA (miRNA) changes using Affymetrix mouse arrays. We identified 48 and 68 differentially expressed genes in short- and long-term groups, respectively. No gene was common between the 2 groups. Short-term (immediate) genes were involved in cellular compromise and apoptosis, which represent ethanol's toxic effects. Long-term genes were involved in various cellular functions, including epigenetics. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed the downregulation of long-term genes: Camk1g, Ccdc6, Egr3, Hspa5, and Xbp1. miRNA arrays identified 20 differentially expressed miRNAs, one of which (miR-302c) was confirmed. miR-302c was involved in an inverse relationship with Ccdc6. A network-based model involving altered genes illustrates the importance of cellular redox, stress and inflammation in FASD. Our results also support a critical role of apoptosis in FASD, and the potential involvement of miRNAs in the adaptation of gene expression following prenatal ethanol exposure. The ultimate molecular footprint involves inflammatory disease, neurological disease and skeletal and muscular disorders as major alterations in FASD. At the cellular level, these processes represent abnormalities in redox, stress and inflammation, with potential underpinnings to anxiety.}},

These disorders are pervasive in Western cultures and represent the most common preventable source of neurodevelopmental disabilities. The genetic and epigenetic etiology of these phenotypes, including those factors that may maintain these phenotypes throughout the lifetime of an affected individual, has become a recent topic of investigation. This review integrates recent data that has progressed our understanding FASD as a continuum of molecular events, beginning with cellular stress response and ending with a long-term “footprint” of epigenetic dysregulation across the genome. It reports on data from multiple ethanol-treatment paradigms in mouse models that identify changes in gene expression that occur with respect to neurodevelopmental timing of exposure and ethanol dose. These studies have identified patterns of genomic alteration that are dependent on the biological processes occurring at the time of ethanol exposure. This review also adds to evidence that epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation may underlie long-term changes to gene expression patterns. These may be initiated by ethanol-induced alterations to DNA and histone methylation, particularly in imprinted regions of the genome, affecting transcription which is further fine-tuned by altered microRNA expression. These processes are likely complex, genome-wide, and interrelated. The proposed model suggests a potential for intervention, given that epigenetic changes are malleable and may be altered by postnatal environment. This review accentuates the value of mouse models in deciphering the molecular etiology of FASD, including those processes that may provide a target for the ammelioration of this common yet entirely preventable disorder.}},

abstract = {{Despite their singular origin, monozygotic twin pairs often display discordance for complex disorders including schizophrenia. It is a common (1\%) and often familial disease with a discordance rate of \textbackslashtextasciitilde50\% in monozygotic twins. This high discordance is often explained by the role of yet unknown environmental, random, and epigenetic factors. The involvement of DNA methylation in this disease appears logical, but remains to be established. We have used blood DNA from two pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia and their parents in order to assess genome-wide methylation using a NimbleGen Methylation Promoter Microarray. The genome-wide results show that differentially methylated regions (DMRs) exist between members representing discordant monozygotic twins. Some DMRs are shared with parent(s) and others appear to be de novo. We found twenty-seven genes affected by DMR changes that were shared in the affected member of two discordant monozygotic pairs from unrelated families. Interestingly, the genes affected by pair specific DMRs share specific networks. Specifically, this study has identified two networks; “cell death and survival” and a “cellular movement and immune cell trafficking”. These two networks and the genes affected have been previously implicated in the aetiology of schizophrenia. The results are compatible with the suggestion that DNA methylation may contribute to the discordance of monozygotic twins for schizophrenia. Also, this may be accomplished by the direct effect of gene specific methylation changes on specific biological networks rather than individual genes. It supports the extensive genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic heterogeneity implicated in schizophrenia.}},

The results were found to be similar in another heterogeneous replication group of six FASD children.

The resulting genome-wide methylation changes are enriched in genes with neurodevelopmental functions. The profile of differential methylation is dynamic and present in some form for life. The methylation changes are transmitted across subsequent mitotic divisions, where they are maintained and further modified over time. More recent follow up has identified a profile of the differential methylation in the buccal swabs of young children born with FASD. While distinct from the profile observed in brain tissue from rodent models, there are similarities. These include changes in genes belonging to a number of neurodevelopmental and behavioral pathways. Specifically, there is increased methylation at the clustered protocadherin genes and deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, even though no single gene is affected in all patients studied to date. These novel results suggest further development of a methylation based strategy could enable early and accurate diagnostics and therapeutics, which have remained a challenge in FASD research. There are two aspects of this challenge that must be addressed in the immediate future: First, the long-term differential methylomics observed in rodent models must be functionally confirmed. Second, the similarities in differential methylation must be further established in humans at a methylomic level and overcome a number of technical limitations. While a cure for FASD is challenging, there is an opportunity for the development of early diagnostics and attenuations towards a higher quality of life.}},

abstract = {{Epigenetic mechanisms are important for facilitating gene-environment interactions in many disease etiologies, including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Extensive research into the role of DNA methylation and miRNAs in animal models has illuminated the complex role of these mechanisms in FASD. In contrast, histone modifications have not been as well researched, due in part to being less stable than DNA methylation and less well-characterized in disease. It is now apparent that even changes in transient marks can have profound effects if they alter developmental trajectories. In addition, many histone methylations are now known to be relatively stable and can propagate themselves. As technologies and knowledge have advanced, a small group has investigated the role of histone modifications in FASD. Here, we synthesize the data on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on histone modifications. Several key points are evident. AS with most alcohol-induced outcomes, timing and dosage differences yield variable effects. Nevertheless, these studies consistently find enrichment of H3K9ac, H3K27me2,3, and H3K9me2, and increased expression of histone acetyltransferases and methyltransferases. The consistency of these alterations may implicate them as key mechanisms underlying FASD. Histone modification changes do not often correlate with gene expression changes, though some important examples exist. Encouragingly, attempts to reproduce specific histone modification changes are very often successful. We comment on possible directions for future studies, focusing on further exploration of current trends, expansion of time-point and dosage regimes, and evaluation of biomarker potential.}},

More than 23,000 diurnally rhythmic CpGs are identified in wild-type cortex, with nearly all lost or phase-shifted in PWS. Circadian dysregulation of a second imprinted Snord cluster at the Temple/Kagami-Ogata syndrome locus is observed at the level of methylation, transcription, and chromatin, providing mechanistic evidence of cross-talk. Genes identified by diurnal epigenetic changes in PWS mice overlapped rhythmic and PWS-specific genes in human brain and are enriched for PWS-relevant phenotypes and pathways. These results support the proposed evolutionary relationship between imprinting and sleep, and suggest possible chronotherapy in the treatment of PWS and related disorders.

Although DNA methylation has been previously examined at select regulatory regions across the genome in a variety of DS tissues and cells, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) have yet to be examined in an unbiased sequencing-based approach. Here, we present the first analysis of DMRs from whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data of human DS and matched control brain, specifically frontal cortex. While no global differences in DNA methylation were observed, we identified 3,152 DS-DMRs across the entire genome, the majority of which were hypermethylated in DS. DS-DMRs were significantly enriched at CpG islands and de-enriched at specific gene body and regulatory regions. Functionally, the hypermethylated DS-DMRs were enriched for one-carbon metabolism, membrane transport, and glutamatergic synaptic signalling, while the hypomethylated DMRs were enriched for proline isomerization, glial immune response, and apoptosis. Furthermore, in a cross-tissue comparison to previous studies of DNA methylation from diverse DS tissues and reference epigenomes, hypermethylated DS-DMRs showed a strong cross-tissue concordance, while a more tissue-specific pattern was observed for the hypomethylated DS-DMRs. Overall, this approach highlights that low-coverage WGBS of clinical samples can identify epigenetic alterations to known biological pathways, which are potentially relevant to therapeutic treatments and include metabolic pathways. These results also provide new insights into the genome-wide effects of genetic alterations on DNA methylation profiles indicative of altered neurodevelopment and brain function.}},

We therefore utilized a systems biology approach to elucidate how UBE3A loss impacts the early postnatal brain in a novel CRISPR/Cas9-engineered rat Angelman model of a complete Ube3a deletion. Strand-specific transcriptome analysis of offspring from maternally or paternally inherited Ube3a deletions revealed the expected parental expression patterns of Ube3a sense and antisense transcripts by postnatal day 2 (P2) in hypothalamus and day 9 (P9) in cortex, compared to wild-type littermates. The dependency of genome-wide effects on parent-of-origin, Ube3a genotype and time (P2 and P9) was investigated through transcriptome (RNA sequencing of cortex and hypothalamus) and methylome (whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of hypothalamus). Weighted gene co-expression and co-methylation network analyses identified co-regulated networks in maternally inherited Ube3a deletion offspring enriched in postnatal developmental processes including Wnt signaling, synaptic regulation, neuronal and glial functions, epigenetic regulation, ubiquitin, circadian entrainment and splicing. Furthermore, we showed that loss of the paternal Ube3a antisense transcript resulted in both unique and overlapping dysregulated gene pathways with maternal loss, predominantly at the level of differential methylation. Together, these results provide a holistic examination of the molecular impacts of UBE3A loss in brain, supporting the existence of interactive epigenetic networks between maternal and paternal transcripts at the Ube3a locus.}},

Here, we performed low-pass whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of 86 NDBS DNA to examine early life Down syndrome (DS) DNA methylation profiles. DS represents an example of genetics shaping epigenetics, as multiple array-based studies have demonstrated that trisomy 21 is characterized by genome-wide alterations to DNA methylation. By assaying over 24 million CpG sites, thousands of genome-wide significant (q < 0.05) differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that distinguished DS from typical development and idiopathic developmental delay were identified. Machine learning feature selection refined these DMRs to 22 loci. The DS DMRs mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, metabolism, and transcriptional regulation. Based on comparisons with previous DS methylation studies and reference epigenomes, the hypermethylated DS DMRs were significantly (q < 0.05) enriched across tissues while the hypomethylated DS DMRs were significantly (q < 0.05) enriched for blood-specific chromatin states. A \textbackslashtextasciitilde28 kb block of hypermethylation was observed on chromosome 21 in the RUNX1 locus, which encodes a hematopoietic transcription factor whose binding motif was the most significantly enriched (q < 0.05) overall and specifically within the hypomethylated DMRs. Finally, we also identified DMRs that distinguished DS NDBS based on the presence or absence of congenital heart disease (CHD). Together, these results not only demonstrate the utility of low-pass WGBS on NDBS samples for epigenome-wide association studies, but also provide new insights into the early life mechanisms of epigenomic dysregulation resulting from trisomy 21.}},

The neonatal epigenome has the potential to reflect past interactions between genetic and environmental factors during early development and influence future health outcomes. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 152 umbilical cord blood samples from the MARBLES and EARLI high-familial risk prospective cohorts to identify an epigenomic signature of ASD at birth. Samples were split into discovery and replication sets and stratified by sex, and their DNA methylation profiles were tested for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between ASD and typically developing control cord blood samples. DMRs were mapped to genes and assessed for enrichment in gene function, tissue expression, chromosome location, and overlap with prior ASD studies. DMR coordinates were tested for enrichment in chromatin states and transcription factor binding motifs. Results were compared between discovery and replication sets and between males and females. We identified DMRs stratified by sex that discriminated ASD from control cord blood samples in discovery and replication sets. At a region level, 7 DMRs in males and 31 DMRs in females replicated across two independent groups of subjects, while 537 DMR genes in males and 1762 DMR genes in females replicated by gene association. These DMR genes were significantly enriched for brain and embryonic expression, X chromosome location, and identification in prior epigenetic studies of ASD in post-mortem brain. In males and females, autosomal ASD DMRs were significantly enriched for promoter and bivalent chromatin states across most cell types, while sex differences were observed for X-linked ASD DMRs. Lastly, these DMRs identified in cord blood were significantly enriched for binding sites of methyl-sensitive transcription factors relevant to fetal brain development. At birth, prior to the diagnosis of ASD, a distinct DNA methylation signature was detected in cord blood over regulatory regions and genes relevant to early fetal neurodevelopment. Differential cord methylation in ASD supports the developmental and sex-biased etiology of ASD and provides novel insights for early diagnosis and therapy.}},

abstract = {{Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by a genome-wide profile of differential DNA methylation that is skewed towards hypermethylation in most tissues, including brain, and includes pan-tissue differential methylation. The molecular mechanisms involve the overexpression of genes related to DNA methylation on chromosome 21. Here, we stably overexpressed the chromosome 21 gene DNA methyltransferase 3L (DNMT3L) in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and assayed DNA methylation at over 26 million CpGs by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) at three different developmental phases (undifferentiated, differentiating, and differentiated). DNMT3L overexpression resulted in global CpG and CpG island hypermethylation as well as thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The DNMT3L DMRs were skewed towards hypermethylation and mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, cellular signaling, and gene regulation. Consensus DNMT3L DMRs showed that cell lines clustered by genotype and then differentiation phase, demonstrating sets of common genes affected across neuronal differentiation. The hypermethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons were enriched for regions of bivalent chromatin marked by H3K4me3 as well as differentially methylated sites from previous DS studies of diverse tissues. In contrast, the hypomethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons displayed a tissue-specific profile enriched for regions of heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 during embryonic development. Taken together, these results support a mechanism whereby regions of bivalent chromatin that lose H3K4me3 during neuronal differentiation are targeted by excess DNMT3L and become hypermethylated. Overall, these findings demonstrate that DNMT3L overexpression during neurodevelopment recreates a facet of the genome-wide DS DNA methylation signature by targeting known genes and gene clusters that display pan-tissue differential methylation in DS.}},

abstract = {{Neurodevelopment in humans is a long, elaborate, and highly coordinated process involving three trimesters of prenatal development followed by decades of postnatal development and maturation. Throughout this period, the brain is highly sensitive and responsive to the external environment, which may provide a range of inputs leading to positive or negative outcomes. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Although the molecular mechanisms of FASD are not fully characterized, they involve alterations to the regulation of gene expression via epigenetic marks. As in the prenatal stages, the postnatal period of neurodevelopment is also sensitive to environmental inputs. Often this sensitivity is reflected in children facing adverse conditions, such as maternal separation. This exposure to early life stress (ELS) is implicated in the manifestation of various behavioral abnormalities. Most FASD research has focused exclusively on the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure in isolation. Here, we review the research into the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure and ELS, with a focus on the continuum of epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations. Interestingly, a select few experiments have assessed the cumulative effect of prenatal alcohol and postnatal maternal separation stress. Regulatory regions of different sets of genes are affected by both treatments independently, and a unique set of genes are affected by the combination of treatments. Notably, epigenetic and gene expression changes converge at the clustered protocadherin locus and oxidative stress pathway. Functional studies using epigenetic editing may elucidate individual contributions of regulatory regions for hub genes and further profiling efforts may lead to the development of non-invasive methods to identify children at risk. Taken together, the results favor the potential to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes by epigenetic management of children born with FASD using favorable postnatal conditions with or without therapeutic interventions.}},

abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves complex genetics interacting with the perinatal environment, complicating the discovery of common genetic risk. The epigenetic layer of DNA methylation shows dynamic developmental changes and molecular memory of in utero experiences, particularly in placenta, a fetal tissue discarded at birth. However, current array-based methods to identify novel ASD risk genes lack coverage of the most structurally and epigenetically variable regions of the human genome. We use whole genome bisulfite sequencing in placenta samples from prospective ASD studies to discover a previously uncharacterized ASD risk gene, LOC105373085, renamed NHIP. Out of 134 differentially methylated regions associated with ASD in placental samples, a cluster at 22q13.33 corresponds to a 118-kb hypomethylated block that replicates in two additional cohorts. Within this locus, NHIP is functionally characterized as a nuclear peptide-encoding transcript with high expression in brain, and increased expression following neuronal differentiation or hypoxia, but decreased expression in ASD placenta and brain. NHIP overexpression increases cellular proliferation and alters expression of genes regulating synapses and neurogenesis, overlapping significantly with known ASD risk genes and NHIP-associated genes in ASD brain. A common structural variant disrupting the proximity of NHIP to a fetal brain enhancer is associated with NHIP expression and methylation levels and ASD risk, demonstrating a common genetic influence. Together, these results identify and initially characterize a novel environmentally responsive ASD risk gene relevant to brain development in a hitherto under-characterized region of the human genome.}},

We conclude that in this model, maternal obesity was associated with changes in the infant brain and behavior, and these differences were detectable in pregnancy through integrative analyses of cffDNA methylation with immune and metabolic factors.

abstract = {{Background Wildfire smoke is responsible for around 20\% of all particulate emissions in the U.S. and affects millions of people worldwide. Children are especially vulnerable, as ambient air pollution exposure during early childhood is associated with reduced lung function. Most studies, however, have focused on the short-term impacts of wildfire smoke exposures. We aimed to identify long-term baseline epigenetic changes associated with early-life exposure to wildfire smoke. We collected nasal epithelium samples for whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) from two groups of adult female rhesus macaques: one group born just before the 2008 California wildfire season and exposed to wildfire smoke during early-life (n = 8), and the other group born in 2009 with no wildfire smoke exposure during early-life (n = 14). RNA-sequencing was also performed on a subset of these samples. Results We identified 3370 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (difference in methylation ≥ 5\%, empirical p < 0.05) and 1 differentially expressed gene (FLOT2) (FDR < 0.05, fold of change ≥ 1.2). The DMRs were annotated to genes significantly enriched for synaptogenesis signaling, protein kinase A signaling, and a variety of immune processes, and some DMRs significantly correlated with gene expression differences. DMRs were also significantly enriched within regions of bivalent chromatin (top odds ratio = 1.46, q-value < 3 × 10-6) that often silence key developmental genes while keeping them poised for activation in pluripotent cells. Conclusions These data suggest that early-life exposure to wildfire smoke leads to long-term changes in the methylome over genes impacting the nervous and immune systems. Follow-up studies will be required to test whether these changes influence transcription following an immune/respiratory challenge.}},

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is considered strongly genetic in origin due to its high heritability. However, the rapidly rising prevalence of ASD suggests that environmental factors may also influence risk for ASD. In the present study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify genome-wide differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in a total of 52 sperm samples from a cohort of men from the Faroe Islands (Denmark) who were equally divided into high and low exposure groups based on their serum levels of the long-lived organochlorine 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), a primary breakdown product of the now banned insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Aside from being considered a genetic isolate, inhabitants of the Faroe Islands have a native diet that potentially exposes them to a wide range of seafood neurotoxicants in the form of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The DMRs were mapped to the human genome using Bismark, a 3-letter aligner used for methyl-seq analyses. Gene ontology, functional, and pathway analyses of the DMR-associated genes showed significant enrichment for genes involved in neurological functions and neurodevelopmental processes frequently impacted by ASD. Notably, these genes also significantly overlap with autism risk genes as well as those previously identified in sperm from fathers of children with ASD in comparison to that of fathers of neurotypical children. These results collectively suggest a possible mechanism involving altered methylation of a significant number of neurologically relevant ASD risk genes for introducing epigenetic changes associated with environmental exposures into the sperm methylome.

Previous studies have largely focused on identifying genetic risk factors associated with CHDs in individuals with DS, but comprehensive studies of the contribution of epigenetic marks are lacking. We aimed to identify and characterize DNA methylation differences from newborn dried blood spots (NDBS) of DS individuals with major CHDs compared to DS individuals without CHDs. We used the Illumina EPIC array and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to quantitate DNA methylation for 86 NDBS samples from the California Biobank Program: (1) 45 DS-CHD (27 female, 18 male) and (2) 41 DS non-CHD (27 female, 14 male). We analyzed global CpG methylation and identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in DS-CHD versus DS non-CHD comparisons (both sex-combined and sex-stratified) corrected for sex, age of blood collection, and cell-type proportions. CHD DMRs were analyzed for enrichment in CpG and genic contexts, chromatin states, and histone modifications by genomic coordinates and for gene ontology enrichment by gene mapping. DMRs were also tested in a replication dataset and compared to methylation levels in DS versus typical development (TD) WGBS NDBS samples. We found global CpG hypomethylation in DS-CHD males compared to DS non-CHD males, which was attributable to elevated levels of nucleated red blood cells and not seen in females. At a regional level, we identified 58, 341, and 3938 CHD-associated DMRs in the Sex Combined, Females Only, and Males Only groups, respectively, and used machine learning algorithms to select 19 Males Only loci that could distinguish CHD from non-CHD. DMRs in all comparisons were enriched for gene exons, CpG islands, and bivalent chromatin and mapped to genes enriched for terms related to cardiac and immune functions. Lastly, a greater percentage of CHD-associated DMRs than background regions were differentially methylated in DS versus TD samples. A sex-specific signature of DNA methylation was detected in NDBS of DS-CHD compared to DS non-CHD individuals. This supports the hypothesis that epigenetics can reflect the variability of phenotypes in DS, particularly CHDs.}},

abstract = {{Sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis by sensing and initiating responses to stimuli. While most preclinical studies of DRGs are conducted in rodents, much less is known about the mechanisms of sensory perception in primates. We generated a transcriptome atlas of mouse, guinea pig, cynomolgus monkey, and human DRGs by implementing a common laboratory workflow and multiple data-integration approaches to generate high-resolution cross-species mappings of sensory neuron subtypes. Using our atlas, we identified conserved core modules highlighting subtype-specific biological processes related to inflammatory response. We also identified divergent expression of key genes involved in DRG function, suggesting species-specific adaptations specifically in nociceptors that likely point to divergent function of nociceptors. Among these, we validated that TAFA4, a member of the druggable genome, was expressed in distinct populations of DRG neurons across species, highlighting species-specific programs that are critical for therapeutic development. Sensory neurons are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Here, the authors generated a single-nuclei cross-species atlas of the dorsal root ganglia, revealing conserved programs for sensory function that could inform therapeutic hypotheses.}},
