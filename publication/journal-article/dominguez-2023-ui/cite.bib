 abstract = {Heterozygous mutations in the granulin (GRN) gene are a leading
cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43
aggregates (FTLD-TDP). Polymorphisms in TMEM106B have been
associated with disease risk in GRN mutation carriers and
protective TMEM106B variants associated with reduced levels of
TMEM106B, suggesting that lowering TMEM106B might be therapeutic
in the context of FTLD. Here, we tested the impact of full
deletion and partial reduction of TMEM106B in mouse and
iPSC-derived human cell models of GRN deficiency. TMEM106B
deletion did not reverse transcriptomic or proteomic profiles in
GRN-deficient microglia, with a few exceptions in immune
signaling markers. Neither homozygous nor heterozygous Tmem106b
deletion normalized disease-associated phenotypes in Grn
-/-mice. Furthermore, Tmem106b reduction by antisense
oligonucleotide (ASO) was poorly tolerated in Grn -/-mice. These
data provide novel insight into TMEM106B and GRN function in
microglia cells but do not support lowering TMEM106B levels as a
viable therapeutic strategy for treating FTD-GRN.},
