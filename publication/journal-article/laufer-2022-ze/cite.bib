 abstract = {Maternal obesity during pregnancy is associated with
neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk. We utilized integrative
multi-omics to examine maternal obesity effects on offspring
neurodevelopment in rhesus macaques by comparison to lean
controls and two interventions. Differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) from longitudinal maternal blood-derived cell-free fetal
DNA (cffDNA) significantly overlapped with DMRs from infant
brain. The DMRs were enriched for neurodevelopmental functions,
methylation-sensitive developmental transcription factor motifs,
and human NDD DMRs identified from brain and placenta. Brain and
cffDNA methylation levels from a large region overlapping mir-663
correlated with maternal obesity, metabolic and immune markers,
and infant behavior. A DUX4 hippocampal co-methylation network
correlated with maternal obesity, infant behavior, infant
hippocampal lipidomic and metabolomic profiles, and maternal
blood measurements of DUX4 cffDNA methylation, cytokines, and
metabolites. We conclude that in this model, maternal obesity was
associated with changes in the infant brain and behavior, and
these differences were detectable in pregnancy through
integrative analyses of cffDNA methylation with immune and
metabolic factors.},
