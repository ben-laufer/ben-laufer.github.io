 abstract = {Environmental exposures to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs)
such as the organochlorines have been linked with various
diseases including neurodevelopmental disorders. Autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) is a highly complex neurodevelopmental disorder
that is considered strongly genetic in origin due to its high
heritability. However, the rapidly rising prevalence of ASD
suggests that environmental factors may also influence risk for
ASD. In the present study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing was
used to identify genome-wide differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) in a total of 52 sperm samples from a cohort of men from
the Faroe Islands (Denmark) who were equally divided into high
and low exposure groups based on their serum levels of the
long-lived organochlorine
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), a primary
breakdown product of the now banned insecticide
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Aside from being
considered a genetic isolate, inhabitants of the Faroe Islands
have a native diet that potentially exposes them to a wide range
of seafood neurotoxicants in the form of persistent organic
pollutants (POPs). The DMRs were mapped to the human genome
using Bismark, a 3-letter aligner used for methyl-seq analyses.
Gene ontology, functional, and pathway analyses of the
DMR-associated genes showed significant enrichment for genes
involved in neurological functions and neurodevelopmental
processes frequently impacted by ASD. Notably, these genes also
significantly overlap with autism risk genes as well as those
previously identified in sperm from fathers of children with ASD
in comparison to that of fathers of neurotypical children. These
results collectively suggest a possible mechanism involving
altered methylation of a significant number of neurologically
relevant ASD risk genes for introducing epigenetic changes
associated with environmental exposures into the sperm
methylome. Such changes may provide the potential for
transgenerational inheritance of ASD as well as other disorders.},
