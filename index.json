Throughout this period, the brain is highly sensitive and responsive to the external environment, which may provide a range of inputs leading to positive or negative outcomes. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Although the molecular mechanisms of FASD are not fully characterized, they involve alterations to the regulation of gene expression via epigenetic marks. As in the prenatal stages, the postnatal period of neurodevelopment is also sensitive to environmental inputs. Often this sensitivity is reflected in children facing adverse conditions, such as maternal separation. This exposure to early life stress (ELS) is implicated in the manifestation of various behavioral abnormalities. Most FASD research has focused exclusively on the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure in isolation. Here, we review the research into the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure and ELS, with a focus on the continuum of epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations. Interestingly, a select few experiments have assessed the cumulative effect of prenatal alcohol and postnatal maternal separation stress. Regulatory regions of different sets of genes are affected by both treatments independently, and a unique set of genes are affected by the combination of treatments. Notably, epigenetic and gene expression changes converge at the clustered protocadherin locus and oxidative stress pathway. Functional studies using epigenetic editing may elucidate individual contributions of regulatory regions for hub genes and further profiling efforts may lead to the development of non-invasive methods to identify children at risk. Taken together, the results favor the potential to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes by epigenetic management of children born with FASD using favorable postnatal conditions with or without therapeutic interventions.","tags":[],"title":"Epigenetic Impacts of Early Life Stress in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Shape the Neurodevelopmental Continuum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin I.

The molecular mechanisms involve the overexpression of genes related to DNA methylation on chromosome 21. Here, we stably overexpressed the chromosome 21 gene DNA methyltransferase 3L (DNMT3L) in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and assayed DNA methylation at over 26 million CpGs by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) at three different developmental phases (undifferentiated, differentiating, and differentiated). Results: DNMT3L overexpression resulted in global CpG and CpG island hypermethylation as well as thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The DNMT3L DMRs were skewed towards hypermethylation and mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, cellular signaling, and gene regulation. Consensus DNMT3L DMRs showed that cell lines clustered by genotype and then differentiation phase, demonstrating sets of common genes affected across neuronal differentiation. The hypermethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons were enriched for regions of bivalent chromatin marked by H3K4me3 as well as differentially methylated sites from previous DS studies of diverse tissues. In contrast, the hypomethylated DNMT3L DMRs from all pairwise comparisons displayed a tissue-specific profile enriched for regions of heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 during embryonic development. Conclusions: Taken together, these results support a mechanism whereby regions of bivalent chromatin that lose H3K4me3 during neuronal differentiation are targeted by excess DNMT3L and become hypermethylated. Overall, these findings demonstrate that DNMT3L overexpression during neurodevelopment recreates a facet of the genome-wide DS DNA methylation signature by targeting known genes and gene clusters that display pan-tissue differential methylation in DS.","tags":["\"Bivalent chromatin\"","\"DNMT3L\"","\"Down syndrome\"","\"Epigenomics\"","\"PiggyBac transgenesis\"","\"Whole genome bisulfite sequencing\""],"title":"Stable DNMT3L overexpression in SH-SY5Y neurons recreates a facet of the genome-wide Down syndrome DNA methylation signature","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Down syndrome (DS) is the leading genetic cause of NDDs and there is variation in the level of intellectual disability amongst patients. While DS is caused by trisomy 21, it represents an example of genetics shaping epigenetics. Reduced representation methods have demonstrated genome-wide differences in DNA methylation in multiple DS tissues and noted a group of genes with pan-tissue hypermethylation, which includes the clustered protocadherins and RUNX1. In our research, we were the first to apply low-pass WGBS to identify DMRs in DS brain samples and neonatal dried blood spots. By assaying regions of the genome that have never been examined before in DS patients, we demonstrated that many of the previously identified differentially methylated single CpG sites are actually part of larger scale DMRs with functional relevance to neurodevelopment. Machine learning feature selection refined these DMRs to 22 loci. We also observed differences related to the one-carbon metabolic pathway that establishes DNA methylation. Finally, we further characterized a dichotomy in the DNA methylation signature of DS, where many of the hypermethylated regions are observed in all tissues (pan-tissue) and many of the hypomethylated regions are tissue-specific. In order to functionally investigate the mechanism of the DS methylation signature, we have also established human neuronal cell culture models of DS (SH-SY5Y and LUHMES), which we transfected with the catalytically inactive but stimulatory DNA methyltransferase DNMT3L that is located on chromosome 21. We found that stable overexpression of DNMT3L recreates a significant proportion of the genome-wide pan-tissue DS DNA hypermethylation profile. However, DNMT3L overexpression alone is not sufficient to recreate the complete DNA methylation profile of DS. Notably, we also a observed a role for the known chromosome 21 encoded transcription factor RUNX1 in neonatal blood, where it was the most differentially methylated region in DS newborns and marked by a large block of hypermethylation that overlaps with its super-enhancer. We observed a genome-wide impact, as all of RUNX1’s binding sites were hypomethylated, which is in line with its known role in demethylating DNA at target genes. Overall, these experiments suggest that DNMT3L drives the pan-tissue hypermethylation profile in all DS tissues, while RUNX1 drives a tissue-specific hypomethylation profile. Although RUNX1 is primarily studied as a hematopoietic transcription factor, we also observed that it was hypermethylated in DS post-mortem brain, which is notable given its known but relatively underexplored role in neurodevelopment.\n","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"24dbfe91d4160dd5e7f23b6d616688bd","permalink":"https://www.benlaufer.com/project/genetic/","publishdate":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/genetic/","section":"project","summary":"Over-expression of *DNMT3L* and *RUNX1* contributes to regional DNA hypermethylation and DNA hypomethylation in Down syndrome brain and blood, respectively.","tags":["Research"],"title":"Genetic Impacts on the Epigenome","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The consumption of alcohol during any stage of pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), with there being no empirically determined safe dose or safe timing of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). FASDs are the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability in the western world. In North America, ~10% of pregnant women and ~20% of breast-feeding women consume alcohol; however, FASDs are diagnosed in only ~2-3% of children. Accurate biomarkers of PAE and its neurodevelopmental impacts are needed, as current diagnostics are not specific to the large number of individuals on the spectrum without craniofacial malformations who require specialized behavioral therapies specific to FASDs. Since some FASD phenotypes can be attenuated by the supplementation of methyl donors from the one-carbon metabolism pathway, DNA methylation plays a key role in the etiology of FASDs. Furthermore, FASDs represent one of a select few common NDDs where the cause is known (PAE), which poises it to provide generalizable insights for NDDs with an environmental component. During my graduate research, we examined a mouse model of a chronic but moderate prenatal alcohol exposure throughout pregnancy. I utilized microarray technologies to integrate genome-wide DNA methylation, microRNA expression, and gene expression profiles of exposed mouse brains at adulthood. Strikingly, while there were genome-wide alterations at all levels, there was a distinct profile of alterations to genomically imprinted clusters of non-coding RNA, which are expressed in a parent-of-origin specific manner and are involved in (neuro)development. These findings were then replicated in other mouse models of PAE, both in collaboration with other members from my graduate lab, as well as by independent laboratories. After establishing that there are long-term alterations to the epigenome in the brains of prenatal alcohol exposed mice, we formed a collaboration with Dr. Joachim Kapalanga (MD-PhD). I examined the DNA methylation profile of cells in the buccal swabs of young children with FASD using the 450K BeadChip array and compared the results to our mouse model. Interestingly, we observed similar alterations to epigenetically sensitive regions that were identified in the rodent models. This work was the first epigenome-wide investigation of children with FASD and has provided the foundation for the possibility of a molecular diagnostic for FASD. The results implicated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within the clustered protocadherins, which establish single-cell neuronal identity, and this result was seen in both adult mouse brains and the buccal swabs of children. Notably, buccal epithelial cells are derived from the neuroectoderm and thus share a close ontogenetic relationship with brain, which may explain the shared epigenomic profile of early neurodevelopment. An independent laboratory has replicated the large-scale protocadherin DMRs and noted the effect of genetic variation in a cohort of children from different ethnicities.\n","date":1585526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585526400,"objectID":"a964a8b7e3c75df640dd92204b4144f3","permalink":"https://www.benlaufer.com/project/environment/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/environment/","section":"project","summary":"DNA hypermethylation of the clustered protocadherins is a conserved signature in adult brains from a mouse model of prenatal alcohol exposure and in buccal swabs from human children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).","tags":["Research"],"title":"Environmental Impacts on the Epigenome","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582588800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582588800,"objectID":"68c2b466d1ab1bc107d82a40f7d9b45a","permalink":"https://www.benlaufer.com/programs/dmrichr/","publishdate":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/programs/dmrichr/","section":"programs","summary":"DMRichR is an R package and executable for the preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and global methylation levels from CpG count matrices (Bismark cytosine reports).","tags":["Software"],"title":"DMRichR","type":"programs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582502400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582502400,"objectID":"01ab26554baf4429ffcad47fb35e9aac","permalink":"https://www.benlaufer.com/programs/cpg_me/","publishdate":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/programs/cpg_me/","section":"programs","summary":"CpG_Me is a whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) pipeline for the alignment and QC of DNA methylation that goes from from raw reads (FastQ) to a CpG count matrix (Bismark cytosine reports).","tags":["Software"],"title":"CpG_Me","type":"programs"},{"authors":["Charles E.

The neonatal epigenome has the potential to reflect past interactions between genetic and environmental factors during early development and influence future health outcomes. Methods: We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 152 umbilical cord blood samples from the MARBLES and EARLI high-familial risk prospective cohorts to identify an epigenomic signature of ASD at birth. Samples were split into discovery and replication sets and stratified by sex, and their DNA methylation profiles were tested for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between ASD and typically developing control cord blood samples. DMRs were mapped to genes and assessed for enrichment in gene function, tissue expression, chromosome location, and overlap with prior ASD studies. DMR coordinates were tested for enrichment in chromatin states and transcription factor binding motifs. Results were compared between discovery and replication sets and between males and females. Results: We identified DMRs stratified by sex that discriminated ASD from control cord blood samples in discovery and replication sets. At a region level, 7 DMRs in males and 31 DMRs in females replicated across two independent groups of subjects, while 537 DMR genes in males and 1762 DMR genes in females replicated by gene association. These DMR genes were significantly enriched for brain and embryonic expression, X chromosome location, and identification in prior epigenetic studies of ASD in post-mortem brain. In males and females, autosomal ASD DMRs were significantly enriched for promoter and bivalent chromatin states across most cell types, while sex differences were observed for X-linked ASD DMRs. Lastly, these DMRs identified in cord blood were significantly enriched for binding sites of methyl-sensitive transcription factors relevant to fetal brain development. Conclusions: At birth, prior to the diagnosis of ASD, a distinct DNA methylation signature was detected in cord blood over regulatory regions and genes relevant to early fetal neurodevelopment. Differential cord methylation in ASD supports the developmental and sex-biased etiology of ASD and provides novel insights for early diagnosis and therapy.","tags":["\"Autism spectrum disorder\"","\"DNA methylation\"","\"Epigenetics\"","\"Epigenome\"","\"Epigenome-wide association study\"","\"Neurodevelopment\"","\"Prospective study\"","\"Umbilical cord blood\"","\"Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing\"","\"X chromosome\""],"title":"Cord blood DNA methylome in newborns later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder reflects early dysregulation of neurodevelopmental and X-linked genes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin I.

Here, we present the first analysis of DMRs from whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data of human DS and matched control brain, specifically frontal cortex. While no global differences in DNA methylation were observed, we identified 3,152 DS-DMRs across the entire genome, the majority of which were hypermethylated in DS. DS-DMRs were significantly enriched at CpG islands and de-enriched at specific gene body and regulatory regions. Functionally, the hypermethylated DS-DMRs were enriched for one-carbon metabolism, membrane transport, and glutamatergic synaptic signalling, while the hypomethylated DMRs were enriched for proline isomerization, glial immune response, and apoptosis. Furthermore, in a cross-tissue comparison to previous studies of DNA methylation from diverse DS tissues and reference epigenomes, hypermethylated DS-DMRs showed a strong cross-tissue concordance, while a more tissue-specific pattern was observed for the hypomethylated DS-DMRs. Overall, this approach highlights that low-coverage WGBS of clinical samples can identify epigenetic alterations to known biological pathways, which are potentially relevant to therapeutic treatments and include metabolic pathways.

Previous studies of UBE3A function have not examined full Ube3a deletion in mouse, the complexity of imprinted gene networks in brain nor the molecular basis of systems-level cognitive dysfunctions in AS. We therefore utilized a systems biology approach to elucidate how UBE3A loss impacts the early postnatal brain in a novel CRISPR/Cas9-engineered rat Angelman model of a complete Ube3a deletion. Strand-specific transcriptome analysis of offspring from maternally or paternally inherited Ube3a deletions revealed the expected parental expression patterns of Ube3a sense and antisense transcripts by postnatal day 2 (P2) in hypothalamus and day 9 (P9) in cortex, compared to wild-type littermates. The dependency of genome-wide effects on parent-of-origin, Ube3a genotype and time (P2 and P9) was investigated through transcriptome (RNA sequencing of cortex and hypothalamus) and methylome (whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of hypothalamus). Weighted gene co-expression and co-methylation network analyses identified co-regulated networks in maternally inherited Ube3a deletion offspring enriched in postnatal developmental processes including Wnt signaling, synaptic regulation, neuronal and glial functions, epigenetic regulation, ubiquitin, circadian entrainment and splicing. Furthermore, we showed that loss of the paternal Ube3a antisense transcript resulted in both unique and overlapping dysregulated gene pathways with maternal loss, predominantly at the level of differential methylation. Together, these results provide a holistic examination of the molecular impacts of UBE3A loss in brain, supporting the existence of interactive epigenetic networks between maternal and paternal transcripts at the Ube3a locus.","tags":[],"title":"Imprinting effects of UBE3A loss on synaptic gene networks and Wnt signaling pathways","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rochelle L.

Genes identified by diurnal epigenetic changes in PWS mice overlapped rhythmic and PWS-specific genes in human brain and are enriched for PWS-relevant phenotypes and pathways.

Here, we employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), and a multiplex microRNA (miRNA) assay to examine the effects of augmented maternal care on DNA cytosine methylation, gene expression, and miRNA expression. A total of 9,439 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with augmented maternal care were identified in male offspring hypothalamus, as well as a modest but significant decrease in global DNA methylation. Differentially methylated and expressed genes were enriched for functions in neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, protein synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as known stress response genes. Twenty prioritized genes were identified as highly relevant to the stress resiliency phenotype. This combined unbiased approach enabled the discovery of novel genes and gene pathways that advance our understanding of the epigenomic mechanisms underlying the effects of maternal care on the developing brain.","tags":["\"\"","\"Augmented maternal care\"","\"DNA methylation\"","\"early-life stress\"","\"epigenomics\"","\"hypothalamus\"","\"resilience\""],"title":"Experience-dependent neuroplasticity of the developing hypothalamus: integrative epigenomic approaches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric J.

Extensive research into the role of DNA methylation and miRNAs in animal models has illuminated the complex role of these mechanisms in FASD. In contrast, histone modifications have not been as well researched, due in part to being less stable than DNA methylation and less well-characterized in disease. It is now apparent that even changes in transient marks can have profound effects if they alter developmental trajectories. In addition, many histone methylations are now known to be relatively stable and can propagate themselves. As technologies and knowledge have advanced, a small group has investigated the role of histone modifications in FASD. Here, we synthesize the data on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on histone modifications. Several key points are evident. AS with most alcohol-induced outcomes, timing and dosage differences yield variable effects. Nevertheless, these studies consistently find enrichment of H3K9ac, H3K27me2,3, and H3K9me2, and increased expression of histone acetyltransferases and methyltransferases. The consistency of these alterations may implicate them as key mechanisms underlying FASD. Histone modification changes do not often correlate with gene expression changes, though some important examples exist. Encouragingly, attempts to reproduce specific histone modification changes are very often successful. We comment on possible directions for future studies, focusing on further exploration of current trends, expansion of time-point and dosage regimes, and evaluation of biomarker potential.","tags":["\"Alcohol\"","\"Epigenetics\"","\"FASD\"","\"G9a\"","\"Gene expression\"","\"H3K27me3\"","\"H3K9ac\"","\"H3K9me2\"","\"Histone\""],"title":"Changes to histone modifications following prenatal alcohol exposure: An emerging picture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin I.

The resulting genome-wide methylation changes are enriched in genes with neurodevelopmental functions. The profile of differential methylation is dynamic and present in some form for life. The methylation changes are transmitted across subsequent mitotic divisions, where they are maintained and further modified over time. More recent follow up has identified a profile of the differential methylation in the buccal swabs of young children born with FASD. While distinct from the profile observed in brain tissue from rodent models, there are similarities. These include changes in genes belonging to a number of neurodevelopmental and behavioral pathways. Specifically, there is increased methylation at the clustered protocadherin genes and deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, even though no single gene is affected in all patients studied to date. These novel results suggest further development of a methylation based strategy could enable early and accurate diagnostics and therapeutics, which have remained a challenge in FASD research. There are two aspects of this challenge that must be addressed in the immediate future: First, the long-term differential methylomics observed in rodent models must be functionally confirmed. Second, the similarities in differential methylation must be further established in humans at a methylomic level and overcome a number of technical limitations. While a cure for FASD is challenging, there is an opportunity for the development of early diagnostics and attenuations towards a higher quality of life.","tags":["\"Clustered protocadherins\"","\"DNA methylation\"","\"Epigenetics\"","\"Epigenomics\"","\"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD)\"","\"Genomic imprinting\"","\"Neurodevelopment\"","\"Neuroepigenomics\"","\"Personalized medicine\"","\"Prenatal alcohol exposure\"","\"Translational research\""],"title":"Long-term alterations to DNA methylation as a biomarker of prenatal alcohol exposure: From mouse models to human children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin I Laufer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627181373,"objectID":"70e85317fdda84f719664c9f437d5590","permalink":"https://www.benlaufer.com/publication/laufer-2016/","publishdate":"2021-07-25T02:49:33.26438Z","relpermalink":"/publication/laufer-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Long-Term Neuroepigenomic Profile of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric J.

It is a common (1%) and often familial disease with a discordance rate of $∼$50% in monozygotic twins. This high discordance is often explained by the role of yet unknown environmental, random, and epigenetic factors. The involvement of DNA methylation in this disease appears logical, but remains to be established. Methods: We have used blood DNA from two pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia and their parents in order to assess genome-wide methylation using a NimbleGen Methylation Promoter Microarray. Results: The genome-wide results show that differentially methylated regions (DMRs) exist between members representing discordant monozygotic twins. Some DMRs are shared with parent(s) and others appear to be de novo. We found twenty-seven genes affected by DMR changes that were shared in the affected member of two discordant monozygotic pairs from unrelated families. Interestingly, the genes affected by pair specific DMRs share specific networks. Specifically, this study has identified two networks; \\\"cell death and survival\\\" and a \\\"cellular movement and immune cell trafficking\\\". These two networks and the genes affected have been previously implicated in the aetiology of schizophrenia. Conclusions: The results are compatible with the suggestion that DNA methylation may contribute to the discordance of monozygotic twins for schizophrenia. Also, this may be accomplished by the direct effect of gene specific methylation changes on specific biological networks rather than individual genes. It supports the extensive genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic heterogeneity implicated in schizophrenia.","tags":["\"DNA Methylation\"","\"Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs)\"","\"Histone Clusters\"","\"MeDIP\"","\"Methylation Array\"","\"Monozygotic Twins\"","\"Schizophrenia\"","\"snoRNA\""],"title":"DNA methylation differences in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia identifies psychosis related genes and networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christina A.

These disorders are pervasive in Western cultures and represent the most common preventable source of neurodevelopmental disabilities. The genetic and epigenetic etiology of these phenotypes, including those factors that may maintain these phenotypes throughout the lifetime of an affected individual, has become a recent topic of investigation. This review integrates recent data that has progressed our understanding FASD as a continuum of molecular events, beginning with cellular stress response and ending with a long-term \\\"footprint\\\" of epigenetic dysregulation across the genome. It reports on data from multiple ethanol-treatment paradigms in mouse models that identify changes in gene expression that occur with respect to neurodevelopmental timing of exposure and ethanol dose. These studies have identified patterns of genomic alteration that are dependent on the biological processes occurring at the time of ethanol exposure. This review also adds to evidence that epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation may underlie long-term changes to gene expression patterns. These may be initiated by ethanol-induced alterations to DNA and histone methylation, particularly in imprinted regions of the genome, affecting transcription which is further fine-tuned by altered microRNA expression. These processes are likely complex, genome-wide, and interrelated. The proposed model suggests a potential for intervention, given that epigenetic changes are malleable and may be altered by postnatal environment.

We have used the C57BL/6J mouse to assess the dynamics of genomic alterations following binge alcohol exposure. Ethanol-exposed fetal (short-term effect) and adult (long-term effect) brains were assessed for gene expression and microRNA (miRNA) changes using Affymetrix mouse arrays. We identified 48 and 68 differentially expressed genes in short- and long-term groups, respectively. No gene was common between the 2 groups. Short-term (immediate) genes were involved in cellular compromise and apoptosis, which represent ethanol's toxic effects. Long-term genes were involved in various cellular functions, including epigenetics. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed the downregulation of long-term genes: Camk1g, Ccdc6, Egr3, Hspa5, and Xbp1. miRNA arrays identified 20 differentially expressed miRNAs, one of which (miR-302c) was confirmed. miR-302c was involved in an inverse relationship with Ccdc6. A network-based model involving altered genes illustrates the importance of cellular redox, stress and inflammation in FASD. Our results also support a critical role of apoptosis in FASD, and the potential involvement of miRNAs in the adaptation of gene expression following prenatal ethanol exposure. The ultimate molecular footprint involves inflammatory disease, neurological disease and skeletal and muscular disorders as major alterations in FASD. At the cellular level, these processes represent abnormalities in redox, stress and inflammation, with potential underpinnings to anxiety. © 2014 S.

This research reports the effects of a therapeutic equivalent treatment of olanzapine on DNA methylation in a rat model in vivo. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using a MeDIP-chip analysis. All methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP), sample labelling, hybridization and processing were performed by Arraystar Inc (Rockville, MD, USA). The identified gene promoters showing significant alterations to DNA methylation were then subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity System Inc, CA, USA). Results: The results show that olanzapine causes an increase in methylation in 1,140, 1,294 and 1,313 genes and a decrease in methylation in 633, 565 and 532 genes in the hippocampus, cerebellum and liver, respectively. Most genes affected are tissue specific. Only 41 affected genes (approximately 3%) showed an increase and no gene showed a decrease in methylation in all three tissues. Further, the two brain regions shared 123 affected genes (approximately 10%). The affected genes are enriched in pathways affecting dopamine signalling, molecular transport, nervous system development and functions in the hippocampus; ephrin receptor signalling and synaptic long-term potentiation in the cerebellum; and tissue morphology, cellular assembly and organization in the liver. Also, the affected genes included those previously implicated in psychosis.

To model a binge-like exposure during the third-trimester neurodevelopmental equivalent, neonate mice were given a high (5 g/kg over 2 h) dose of ethanol at postnatal day 7. Acute transcript changes within the brain were assessed using expression arrays and analyzed for associations with gene ontology functional categories, canonical pathways, and gene network interactions. The short-term effect of ethanol was characterized by an acute stress response and a downregulation of energetically costly cellular processes. Further, alterations to a number of genes with roles in synaptic transmission and hormonal signaling, particularly those associated with the neuroendocrine development and function, were evident. Ethanol exposure during synaptogenesis was also associated with altered histone deacetylase and microRNA transcript levels, suggesting that abnormal epigenetic patterning may maintain some of the persistent molecular consequences of developmental ethanol exposure.

What mechanisms initiate and maintain these changes are not known, but current research suggests a role for alcohol-induced epigenetic changes. In this study we assessed alterations to adult mouse brain tissue by assaying DNA cytosine methylation and small noncoding RNA (ncRNA) expression, specifically the microRNA (miRNA) and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) subtypes. We found long-lasting alterations in DNA methylation as a result of fetal alcohol exposure, specifically in the imprinted regions of the genome harboring ncRNAs and sequences interacting with regulatory proteins. A large number of major nodes from the identified networks, such as Pten signaling, contained transcriptional repressor CTCF-binding sites in their promoters, illustrating the functional consequences of alcohol-induced changes to DNA methylation. Next, we assessed ncRNA expression using two independent array platforms and quantitative PCR. The results identified 34 genes that are targeted by the deregulated miRNAs. Of these, four (Pten, Nmnat1, Slitrk2 and Otx2) were viewed as being crucial in the context of FASDs given their roles in the brain. Furthermore, ∼20% of the altered ncRNAs mapped to three imprinted regions (Snrpn-Ube3a, Dlk1-Dio3 and Sfmbt2) that showed differential methylation and have been previously implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The findings of this study help to expand on the mechanisms behind the long-lasting changes in the brain transcriptome of FASD individuals. The observed changes could contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the long-lasting effect of alcohol. © 2013.

Multiple lines of evidence, including blockage of dopamine receptors by antipsychotic drugs that are used to treat schizophrenia, support the hypothesis. However, the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) blockade cannot explain some important aspects of the therapeutic effect of antipsychotic drugs. In this study, we hypothesized that antipsychotic drugs could affect the transcription of genes in the DA pathway by altering their epigenetic profile.nnMETHODS: To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of olanzapine, a commonly used atypical antipsychotic drug, on the DNA methylation status of genes from DA neurotransmission in the brain and liver of rats. Genomic DNA isolated from hippocampus, cerebellum, and liver of olanzapine treated (n = 2) and control (n = 2) rats were analyzed using rat specific methylation arrays.nnRESULTS: Our results show that olanzapine causes methylation changes in genes encoding for DA receptors (dopamine D1 receptor, dopamine D2 receptor and dopamine D5 receptor), a DA transporter (solute carrier family 18 member 2), a DA synthesis (differential display clone 8), and a DA metabolism (catechol-O-methyltransferase). We assessed a total of 40 genes in the DA pathway and found 19 to be differentially methylated between olanzapine treated and control rats. Most (17/19) genes showed an increase in methylation, in their promoter regions with in silico analysis strongly indicating a functional potential to suppress transcription in the brain.nnCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that chronic olanzapine may reduce DA activity by altering gene methylation. It may also explain the delayed therapeutic effect of antipsychotics, which occurs despite rapid dopamine blockade. Furthermore, given the common nature of epigenetic variation, this lends insight into the differential therapeutic response of psychotic patients who display adequate blockage of dopamine receptors.","tags":["\"\"","\"dna methylation\"","\"dopamine\"","\"epigenetics\"","\"olanzapine\"","\"psychosis\""],"title":"Olanzapine induced DNA methylation changes support the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Randa L.

Prenatal alcohol exposure results in life-long disorders that may manifest in part through the induction of long-term gene expression changes, potentially maintained through epigenetic mechanisms. Findings: Here we report a decrease in the expression of Canabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1) and an increase in the expression of the regulatory microRNA miR-26b in the brains of adult mice exposed to ethanol during neurodevelopment. Furthermore, we show that miR-26b has significant complementarity to the 3′-UTR of the Cnr1 transcript, giving it the potential to bind and reduce the level of Cnr1 expression. Conclusions: These findings elucidate a mechanism through which some genes show long-term altered expression following prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to persistent alterations to cognitive function and behavioural phenotypes observed in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. © 2013 Stringer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","tags":["\"\"","\"Cannabinoid receptor 1\"","\"Epigenetics\"","\"Gene regulation\"","\"MicroRNA\"","\"Mouse\"","\"Neurodevelopment\"","\"Prenatal alcohol exposure\""],"title":"Reduced expression of brain cannabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1) is coupled with an increased complementary micro-RNA (miR-26b) in a mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin I.

Approximately 30% of parentally imprinted transcripts are ncRNAs that are found abundantly - and in some cases specifically - in the brain; however, the role ncRNA plays during development and day-to-day life is not apparent. Interestingly, $∼$1,300 transcripts show a consistent parental expression bias in the brain. This is in contrast to most tissues that show only rare imprinted transcripts. Furthermore, there are only two clusters of imprinted small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) encoding genes in mammals, which are also expressed in the brain. These clusters, Snrpn-Ube3a (Human 15q11–q13/Murine 7qC) and Dlk1-Dio3 (Human 14q32.2/Murine 12qF1) and rodent specific Sfmbt2 (Murine 2qA1), form the focus of this review. These imprinted clusters are localized to imprinted regions that are associated with processes involved in neuronal plasticity and several neurodevelopmental disorders. Several miRNAs from the Dlk1-Dio3 region are also involved in chromatin methylation and remodelling. The final loci of interest is the proximal region of murine chromosome 2 that contains Sfmbt2 and an overlapping antisense transcript that is unique within mice and rats. This suggests that Sfmbt2 may be in the process of becoming imprinted that is being driven by a cluster of intergenic miRNAs. Ultimately, imprinted clusters of ncRNA have the potential to offer novel insight into the understanding of the complex processes of cognition given their role in brain function.","tags":["\"\"","\"dio3\"","\"dlk1\"","\"imprinting\"","\"mirna\"","\"ncrna\"","\"nervous systems\"","\"sfmbt2\"","\"snorna\"","\"snrpn\"","\"ube3a\""],"title":"A Macro Role for Imprinted Clusters of MicroRNAs in the Brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Morgan L.

Previously, we reported that a mouse model for FASD based on voluntary maternal ethanol consumption throughout gestation resulted in offspring that showed mild developmental delay, anxiety-related traits, and deficits in spatial learning. Here, we extend this model by evaluating the gene expression changes that occur in the adult brain of C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to ethanol via maternal preference drinking. The results of two independent expression array experiments indicate that ethanol induces subtle but consistent changes to global gene expression. Gene enrichment analysis showed over-represented gene ontology classifications of cellular, embryonic, and nervous system development. Molecular network analysis supported these classifications, with significant networks related to cellular and tissue development, free radical scavenging, and small molecule metabolism. Further, a number of genes identified have previously been implicated in FASD-relevant neurobehavioural phenotypes such as cognitive function (Ache, Bcl2, Cul4b, Dkc1, Ebp, Lcat, Nsdh1, Sstr3), anxiety (Bcl2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Nsdh1), and mood disorders (Bcl2, Otx2, Sstr3). The results suggest a complex residual \\\"footprint\\\" of neurodevelopmental ethanol exposure that may provide a new perspective for identifying mechanisms that underlie the life-long persistence of FASD-related cognitive and behavioural alterations, including potential targets for treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
